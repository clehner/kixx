  The Kixx Bootstrapper is an extension designed for the Mozilla Firefox and
  Google Chrome web browsers that provides a plugin platform for a modular
  system of applications called "toolpacks".
  </p>
  <p>
  The main goal of Kixx is to provide a simple means of installing and
  importing internal code libraries and user facing toolpack applications.  The
  philosophy behind Kixx is to keep everything modular, facilitating faster and
  more innovative development of more complex internet enabled software systems
  than what the host browsers provide on their own.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is important to note that Kixx is in the very early stages of development,
  and what you are looking at here is the 0.1 pre-release alpha version. To
  date there is no way to install or use Kixx on the Google Chrome browser, but
  plans are underway to add that capability.  Kixx is an open source software
  project, and is inviting users and developers to get involved in the early
  stages of the project. Kixx has the potential to shape the way we use the
  internet in the future, but without your input, it will remain a small
  fringe project.  Kixx needs comments, concerns, and requests from users, as 
  well as contributions from developers and designers. As you can see, there is
  not much to comment on yet, but please stay up to date with the project
  through the Kixx website:

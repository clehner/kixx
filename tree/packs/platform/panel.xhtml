  The Kixx Bootstrapper is an extension designed for the Mozilla Firefox web
  browser that provides a plugin platform for a modular system of applications
  called "toolpacks".
  </p>
  <p>
  The main goal of Kixx is to provide a simple means of installing, persisting,
  importing, and managing client side modules including code libraries and user
  facing toolpack applications.  The philosophy behind Kixx is to maintain an
  extremely modular environment, facilitating more efficient and innovative
  development of complex Internet enabled software systems using web browsers as
  the platform. The Kixx environment is designed to use common web technologies
  including (X)HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
  With the modularity philosophy in mind, Kixx provides toolpack developers
  with the CommonJS modular JavaScript architechture. You can learn more about
  CommonJS on the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS">wiki</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  It is important to note that Kixx is in the very early stages of development,
  and what you are looking at here is a pre-release alpha version.
  Do not expect it to be stable, bug free, or user friendly.
